# AKurowski---FDTD-based-Acoustic-Diffuser-Design-Toolkit
 A set of scripts used in my PhD dissertation. It allows to design Schroeder acoustic diffusers with use of deep reinforcement learning, genetic algorithms, and random design. The design process employing reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms is driven by a coubled physical simulation of acoustic waves propagation.
